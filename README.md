# Ran-Dog

Ran-Dog is a random dog photo generator that brings you photos of canines and sometimes humans!

## Technologies Used:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)

The DogImager.js file has a function newPhoto() that uses the `fetch()` method to call on the Dog API. This retrieves the photos' links from the Dog API's data that can be used to display the many dogs! 

## Run it locally!
1. Fork or clone the repository on your preferred Code Editor!
    <br>`git clone https://github.com/gprmarquez/ran-dog.git`
2. Navigate into the cloned folder.
3. Run `yarn`. This should install the dependencies in the package.json file.
4. Run `yarn start` to get the program running!
5. Enjoy photos of dogs!
